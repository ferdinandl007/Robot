# ARKit Home Robot

## info
In this project, I aim to experiment with the feasibility of Leveraging the recent advances in com- mercial AR toolkits(APIs), for autonomous indoor navigation for an open-source robot Romo. With the following high-level requirements, The navigation will need to be robust enough to navi- gate around objects in a static multi-room environment as well as navigate through different rooms and corridors. Additionally, the robot will work with a dynamic map meaning that new map infor- mation is captured at all times by the robot to inform its decision-making about its path planning.
The robot inputs should only consist of cameras for navigation and an external wireless control device for target acquisition and debugging outputs. As the robot only has access to one sin- gle camera, monocular slam would be an ideal candidate for providing an excellent simultaneous localisation and mapping strategy.
